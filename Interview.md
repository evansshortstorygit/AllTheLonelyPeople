# The Interview

Scott's 32nd first date was on Zoom.  It was 8AM, and on a Tuesday, meaning he barely had time to drag a comb through his unruly hair and give his black beard a good rinse.  The sunrises were getting earlier in Sacramento (not that this phonemon was unique), and from the window Scott could see the light and feel the warmth.  It was going to be a gorgeous and mild day.

Oh, how he hated that.  It would be like this for three weeks, at the most, and then the temperature would jump to 100.  Regardless, he thought, there would certainly be allergies.

A young woman's face showed up on the screen, a pleasant and heart-shaped one that would have been a nice surprise, had the two not already looked each other up through numerous links on Facebook, Instagram, and whatever else came from reverse Googling the aforementioned photos.  *Wearing a tasteful outfit*, wrote Scott on a piece of paper.  *Does not dress well*, wrote the young woman into hers.

"Hello!" she said cheerfully, "is now still a good time for you to talk?"

"Absolutely."

"Excellent.  Why don't you start by telling me a little bit about the last woman you dated, why it didn't work out, who broke up with whom, and how you feel about it?"

"It was pretty much mutual," responded Scott, in what was essentially his standard reaction to this very standard dating question.  What he left out was how it had less to do with free agency, and more to do with their realization that the binding contract they agreed on didn't actually say "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" anywhere.  "One of us wanted marraige.  One of us didn't.  It didn't work."

"And why didn't you want marraige?"

"No, I'm the one who did."

The young woman did a double take, frantically crossed something out on her notebook, and then asked, "So you do want marraige?"

"Not anymore," said Scott, without skipping a beat.  "That encounter left me heart-broken.  I didn't date again for a very, very long time."  Actually, this had happened three weeks ago.  In Scott's scale, that was an eternity.

"What was she like?" asked the young woman.

"Gorgeous.  Successful.  Smart.  Exactly like you, in a nutshell."  The woman wrote *does not make smooth transitions* on her notebook.

"Which is why I have to ask...why did you reject Steven like that?"

"What?"

"Steven.  Nice build, medium height.  Likes to wear a J-crew.  He showed up as a reference when I searched you.  Why did you reject him like that?"

"Steven was not listed as a reference.  But, to be completely honest with you, he wasn't my type."

"Fair enough.  Your turn again."

"Okay.  The next section, as you can probably imagine, is scenarios.  It's important that we establish your basic technical abilities before moving back into behavioral."

"Shoot."

"The house is on fire.  You have enough time to save only your wife, or your child.  Which do you save?"

"Whoever has the higher probability of survival."

"Which way do you turn a screw-driver?"

"Lefty loosey, righty tighty."

"How do you feel about the 2020 election?"

"The only sensible candidate dropped out, so I'm going with Bernie."

"Corgis, or samoyeds?"

"Sammy.  Corgis are overrated.  The samoyed, on the other hand...oh my gosh."

"There is a runnaway trolley racing toward five tied-up people.  Your only way to save them is to flip a switch and change the track, so that all five survive.  The caveat is that the new track has a single tied-up person.  By pulling the switch, you directly cause the death of one person to save five.  Do you do it?"

"How important is the one?"

"You don't know them."

"Then I would pull it.  Higher probability we're maximizing utility in this instance."

"Thank you for your time."

"That's it?"

"Yup.  I have all the information I need.  I will call you in 3-4 business days with next steps."

Scott never heard from her again, but 3-4 business days is all it took for him to line up three in-person dates on the following Saturday night.
