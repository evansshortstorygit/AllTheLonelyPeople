# After the Crisis

*At some unspecified time in the future, the United States reports no new deaths as a result of COVID-19 and everything in the country very abruptly reopens.  Scott gives a demo for the military, Decker visits his family, and Amy attends a long-delayed memorial service for her grandfather*

"It seems wasteful," said Amy's mother, commenting on the uncharacteristically festive way the long, black car in front of them was tossing paper money out of the window.  *Joss paper*, this was called.  In alignment with Daoist tradition, it was believed that burning or literally throwing this paper into the wind would ensure the spirit would be rich or the afterlife.  Or maybe it represented the ethereal nature of wealth.  Or maybe it was for fun.  The practices of Daoism were strange and sacreligious to Amy, as were many of the things her family did whenever she had to return home.

"Bad for the environment, too," said Amy, even though she didn't really care.  After the cars parked, 50 people or more went out to pay their respects.  It was a gorgeous day, possibly.  Amy actually had a preference for rain and snow, but this was summer.  It was so hot that Amy could feel the sweat sticking to her dark clothing.

Amy had always loved her grandfather, but she had had a strange way of showing it.  There were no tears as she greeted each family member whose name she had forgotten.  There were no smiles, no introductions when she finally took the podium to speak about her grandfather and his life.  If anything, maybe he was the only one in the world who understood.  Amy never did particularly well with showing emotion, with making expressions, with inflecting her voice the way much of her family would have described as normal.

At least, that's what her grandfather always told her.

About 150 miles away, Scott was giving a presentation to a bunch of suits and military uniforms.

"And that concludes my demonstration," said Scott with a smile.  The faces around him were either smiling or stone-faced, depending on whether they were civilian engineers who had made the project or military engineers or had just watched the project.  

"That was incredible," said a colonel, with absolutely no expression in his voice, "that is, without question, the greatest demo I have ever seen.  It is amazing you and your team were able to do this given the...unique circumstances."

"Indeed," said a second colonel, also with absolutely no expression in his voice, "we will have to continue this discussion at the bar."

Scott decided to leave early before the bar conversations, but the next day he would receive three congratulatory emails, a $200 gift certificate, and a kind email from the chief engineer himself reminding Scott of his essential role.  That night Scott would proceed to go to bed early, get dressed in a suit and tie, and drive to Folsom on an off-Friday for his long-delayed onsite interview at Intel.

"I'm good," Decker told his friend, in San Francisco and appromixmately 100 miles away from where Scott stood.  They were sitting in the grass at a park, a crowded and bustling place that was a ghost town just three weeks before.

"Suit yourself," she said, as she took another long hit out of the blunt.  Common San Francisco etiquette dictated that you never turned down a blunt, but Decker was a rare exception to the rule.

"As I was saying," continued Decker, "it would be racist, bigoted, and absolutely inappropriate to blame random Asian people for what has happened in recent events."

"Absolutely racist and bigoted," agreed his friend.

"But to blame this on the misactions, poor behavior, and non-cooperation of the corrupted Chinese government, a government that still refuses, even now, to disclose accurate counts on who died and who was sick?  That's a different story."

"Oh no..."

"To say that this was China's fault, if by China you mean the Chinese government, seems appropriate to me.  And now that same country whose pandemic brought the entire world to its knees has the gall to maintain its military posturing?  What nerve."

His friend looked around to see if any heads had turned.  "Can we please...can we PLEASE not argue this now?"

"All I'm saying is that I understand why things changed like they had."

"And all I'm saying is that, considering this, I'd have thought we would finally make some much-needed reforms to our healthcare infrastructure, instead of blindly deciding that the solution was to pour MORE money into military efforts."

"Look," said Decker, "I'm not allowed to get high, but can we go to a bar somewhere?"

They were just a couple of blocks away from Bi-rite.  The line stretched all the way to somewhere in view.

"Let's get ice cream," said his friend, "I could really go for that right now."
