*There are two terms you should know - feminist, and misandrist.  It's important to understand the distinction.  A feminist believes in equal rights for women.  That's a good thing.  A misandrist is someone who simply hates you because you're male.  That's unacceptable.  If you are certain the person you have described to me is the latter, get out and get out as soon as you can.  Dating a misandrist is like being white and dating someone who's racist against white people.*

# The Future is Stupid

Amy's knees were bent in prayer.  "Heavenly father," she began, "hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come...Heavenly Father, across the ocean our enemy is gathering.  Let those who follow you be saved by your light, and let those who defy you perish by it.  Let me always be by your side and in your light in the war to come.  I am but an instrument, weak and frail, but with you to guide me I may carry out your will.  May my fear dissolve.  May the enemy fear you and what you have made us capable of.  In Jesus' name, amen."

She went to the bathroom, brushed her hair, and then came back.

"Oh yeah, one more thing," she said, her knees bent again, "with me luck on this date."

It took 30 minutes to drive to Sacramento...longer if there was traffic.  As Amy got in her car and adjusted the mirror, she couldn't help but think about the times she would take the long drive to San Francisco just to pick her grandfather up from the airport.  *Not now*, she thought, trying to focus less on her emotional pain and more on whether to enter I-8-E or I-80W when coming from this direction.
