# The Breakup

"I may not look it, but I'm almost 30," Decker began, "and every day I spend out here is a day wasted.  This town is dead.  This company is dead.  My life is slipping away from me, and every second I spend here is a second wasted."

"How long have you felt this way?" asked his manager, who felt that this bi-weekly 1:1 was not going according to plan.

"From the beginning."

"And when's the last time you didn't feel this way?"

"When I was at my previous company."

Room 2256 was technically a conference room, but it looked more like a repurposed office.  Jammed inside this cramped space were two chairs, a hardly-noticed poster that said "The Beneifts of Agile" in 48 pt font, a whiteboard, and a single monitor that served as a projector for those unlucky enough to have to hold a tiny meeting here.
